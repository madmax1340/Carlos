<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I probably spend to much time on the computer. As you may be able to predict, my name is Max. My passion for programming and computers started when I was very young. I spent my time playing video games like Mario and Lego Star Wars. <br> <img src="https://steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net/steam/apps/32440/header.jpg?t=1489099167"><br>These games inspired me to want to create a game of my own one day. When I was in sixth grade I was introduced to the coding club and quickly went off on my own and started learning web programming. I soon looked into making desktop and mobile applications. Most of what I learned was from trial and error and through multiple resources on the internet. Recently, I have been working more on web apps because the basics of web programming are very easy and something I can do when I’m bored. <br><img src="https://static.makeuseof.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/html5-whats-new-670x335.jpg"><br>The first game I ever published on the web was ‘Plastic Clicker’. It was a game I had made for a project in the social studies class I was taking at the time. The project was about making something that could help the community. My game was made for kids to learn about plastic in the environment and that everyone should recycle. When playing the game, users at certain points must answer trivia questions  about plastic to continue. Since I made that game, I have been working on other games to put on my newly created website, which I’m sure you may be familiar with, ‘CoolMaxGames’. The games on my site range from clicker games to multiplayer games similar to ‘Pong’ (released in 1972). My purpose for starting this blog is to inform people about CoolMaxGames, programming, and computer parts.</p>
