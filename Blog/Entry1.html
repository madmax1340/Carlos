	<h3>C# vs Javascript</h3>
    <h5>March 18, 2018</h5>
    <p>Beginners looking to start programming have many choices of languages to use. Today we  are going to compare two script languages, Javascript and C#. These languages have a lot in common while also being completely different.
</p>
<h4>Functionality</h4>
<p>The purposes for using javascript and C# are very different. For starters as freelance writer, Peter Wayner, said in his article <a href=”https://techbeacon.com/app-dev-testing/javascript-vs-other-languages-live-long-prosper”>"JavaScript vs. other languages: Live long and prosper?"</a>, “C# is strongly typed, while javascript isn’t”. This means that C# (a more strongly typed language) has more rules to follow when programming. Assisting problem solving, these stricter rules provide results that are less unpredictable such as result you have get from a javascript program. Additionally javascript and C# can be used for very different purposes. Javascript is mainly used for creating functionality in web based programs such as or in a website. However, to use javascript for a website, the language HTML must be used in addition to do almost anything on the website. C# can be used for applications that are able to be opened on the Windows operating system, or it can also be used with other programs and used to make apps on mobile devices such as an iPhone or android device. If one is deciding between these two languages they should look at the programs they want to make and what they want them to do. Their decision from that may determine the language they use.</p>
<h4>Job Openings</h4>
<p>Programming languages are used for personal use, but also commercial. Tech, leadership, and innovation reporter, Lydia Dishman, wrote in her article <a  href=”https://www.fastcompany.com/3060883/why-coding-is-the-job-skill-of-the-future-for-everyone”>“Why Coding Still The Most Important Job Skill of The Future"</a>, she wrote that in just 2015, there was up to 7 million jobs that involve computer programming skills. The market for these jobs is very large and people may be wondering what they have to learn. Javascript and C# are viable options for what to learn. Problematically, many may not know what language to choose. According to <a href=”indeed.com”>Indeed.com</a>, there are currently 29,517 C# jobs, 21,275 of the sort have an estimated salary of $90,000. However, there are 40,265 Javascript job openings and 28,933 with the estimated salary of $90,000. While the total jobs open right now is much greater for javascript jobs, the amount of jobs with a salary of $90,000 are much closer in numbers. This means the likeliness of getting a job with any price range is higher for Javascript than C#. The chance of getting a job with a salary close to $90,000 is much more similar between the two languages. The language choice to start learning to program may depend more on other factors rather than job openings in this setting.</p>
<h4>Chose Javascript if,</h4>
<p>You are interested in making websites. Furthermore, you must keep in mind that to do anything with javascript in a website you must have at least some basic knowledge of HTML. This website itself was made with mainly just three languages (this excludes some games that were made with others), HTML, Javascript, and CSS. Additionally, Javascript has more job openings on <a href=”indeed.com”>Indeed.com</a> than C#, which could lead to a higher chance on you getting a job. Javascript is also able to be typed and saved as a .js from almost any text editor that comes preinstalled into almost all computers, compared to how you must download Microsoft’s <a href=”https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/”>Visual Studio</a> to use C#.</p>
<h4>Choose C# if,</h4>
<p>You are interested in making applications for a computer or mobile device. Additionally if used through a seperate program it is possible to make a C# app on a website. The ‘Tennis’ game on <a href=”https://coolmaxgames.netlify.com/home”>CoolMaxGames</a> was made in C# by myself. Furthermore, C# may be your choice because it is strongly typed, and gives less unexpected errors.</p>
